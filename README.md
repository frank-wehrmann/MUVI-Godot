# MUVI-Godot  
**Multi-User Virtual Reality Inclusion Framework for Godot**

MUVI-Godot is an open-source modular framework for developing **inclusive multi-user VR learning applications** using the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).  
It provides plugins and reference implementations for accessibility, communication, and cooperative learning scenarios in virtual environments.

---

## 🧩 Overview
MUVI (*Multi-User Virtual Reality Inclusion*) aims to support developers of educational and research-oriented VR applications by offering reusable, open modules for:

- **Multi-User networking** (P2P, Web-App Gateway and client-server)
- **Inclusion and accessibility** (adaptive interfaces, multiple input modalities)
- **Communication and cooperation** (asymmetric interaction, non-verbal cues)
- **Learning and analytics** (tracking and evaluation tools)

Each module is designed to be independent, composable, and compatible with other open-source Godot add-ons.

## 🚧 Project Status
This repository is currently in early development.  
Initial work focuses on framework design, modular architecture, and prototype Godot plugins.

---

## 📚 Background
MUVI-Godot builds on research in **inclusive virtual learning environments**, combining design-based research methods with open-source software practices.  
It is part of a broader initiative to make immersive learning technologies more equitable and participatory.

---

## 🔧 Installation (coming soon)
Instructions for installing and using individual MUVI modules within a Godot project will be added as prototypes are released.
